1. Java Access Modifiers

public: 
   - Class: The class is accessible from any other class.
   - Method/Variable: The method or variable is accessible from any other class.

protected:
   - Class: The class is accessible within its own package and by subclasses.
   - Method/Variable: The method or variable is accessible within its own package and by subclasses, even if they are in different packages.

default (no modifier):
   - Class: The class is accessible only within its own package.
   - Method/Variable: The method or variable is accessible only within its own package. If no access modifier is specified, 
   the default access level applies.

private:
   - Class: The class cannot be private (except for inner classes).
   - Method/Variable: The method or variable is accessible only within the class it is defined in.

 2. Difference Between Exception and Error

Exception: This represents an issue that occurs during the execution of a program and can typically be handled or recovered from.
Exceptions are conditions that a program can anticipate and respond to, such as file not found, network errors, or invalid input.

Error: This represents serious issues that are not intended to be handled by programs. 
Errors usually indicate problems with the runtime environment or system-level issues, such as memory leaks or hardware failures. 
For example, OutOfMemoryError or StackOverflowError.


 3. Difference Between Checked and Unchecked Exception

- Checked Exception: These are exceptions that must be either caught or declared in the method signature using the throws keyword. 
They are checked at compile-time. The programmer is required to handle these exceptions explicitly.
  - Examples: IOException, ClassNotFoundException

- Unchecked Exception: These exceptions are not checked at compile-time. They are derived from RuntimeException and its subclasses. 
The programmer is not required to handle these exceptions explicitly, though it is often good practice to do so.
  - Examples: NullPointerException, ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException
